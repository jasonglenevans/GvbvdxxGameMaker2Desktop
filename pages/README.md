# about
gvbvdxx game maker 2 is a open source game maker, its just like MIT's scratch.

# modifing the source

its very easy unlike scratch, you dont need any console app, or wait for a build to finish, ritten in plain html, css, javascript.

first you need to know these things first:

HTML - gui.

JS - the code for running the editor, and the player.

CSS (optinal) - to edit the styles of the editor and gui.

ok now we have gone over the basics of Gvbvdxx game maker 2, so lets get started.

first download the source, then extract and open into the folder, you will see a index.html file.

now open it with your text editor, locate line 10, then replace the "false" with true, this will make it easy to edit the player.
